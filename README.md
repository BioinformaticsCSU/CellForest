# CellForest
Cell Forest is a method for single cell clustering that is aimed at improving clustering accuracies through feature selection. Based on a large-scale analysis of 20 real world scRNA-seq datasets that cover a wide spectrum of biological scenarios, it was found that Cell Forest achieved, on average, superior performances to six benchmark methods inlcuding RAFSIL2, SIMLR and SC3.
